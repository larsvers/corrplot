            Structured data tends to come in rows for observations and columns
            for variables. Whenever you run into a new dataset, it seems a good
            idea to stroll along its columns in order to establish a data
            profile &mdash; running frequencies, calculating normal values and
            checking for missings.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this first meet is more of a personal chat with each column
            the second one typically gets more social in that you might want to
            understand relations between variables. A correlation matrix offers
            a good overview of associationss between at least all the numerical
            variables in the set.

            Correlation matrices aren't very complex and provide a quick and
            efficient read. All your variables are in the rows
            <strong>AND</strong> in the columns. The circles encode the
            correlation strength with size and lightness as well as the
            correlation direction with the circle's hue.
            <span class="orange">Orange</span> for negative and
            <span class="blue">blue</span> for positive correlations in this
            case. <br /><br />This is all there is to know to efficiently look
            up any correlation of interest like for example the correlation
            between a wine's pH values and Citric Acid,
          </p>
          <p id="section-empty">
            which &mdash; given the orange tint &mdash; seems to be negative,
            and of significant size with -0.54 in this case.
          </p>
          <p id="section-2">
            Or between alcohol and density, also negative, telling us that the
            higher the alcohol → the lower the density.
          </p>
          <p id="section-3">
            Or between the crucial wine quality and alcohol, which &mdash; maybe
            unsurpsingly &mdash; is positive. The higher the alcohol → the
            higher the quality (we can sense the limits of correlations in
            reality here as there's probably a tipping point a simple
            correlation won't capture).
          </p>
          <p id="section-4">
            As nice and efficient as this all is, it carries some slack, we can
            prune away; like for example the diagonal of auto-correlations. It's
            obvious that each variable is perfectly positively correlated with
            itself. So let's chop it off..

            But there's more to cut. In fact, more than half of the matrix can
            go, as the bottom right is just a reflection of the upper left.
          </p>
          <p id="section-6">
            This is it, I guess. To get a full overview, we can't really cut
            away anything else. We can tilt it into a correlation pyramid for
            different aesthetics,
          </p>
          <p id="section-7">
            ...but that's a matter of taste. <br /><br />Now, the reason I
            started climbing down the correlation matrix basement to start with,
            was a faint call from the 3rd dimension. Whenever I look at
            correlation matrices, my inner eye doesn't only see circles
            <span class="small-image"
              ><img class="small" src="static/img/circle.jpg"
            /></span>
            encoding correlation strength and direction but bars, or cylinders
            <span class="small-image"
              ><img class="full" src="static/img/cylinder.jpg"
            /></span>
            pointing up or down. We can't see them as we're looking straight
            down onto its flat surface, but I thought they might be worth to be
            excavated. <br /><br />It turns out the 3rd dimension isn't all too
            helpful when you have a full matrix &mdash; as you can't see the
            tree for the forest. Too busy. <br /><br />BUT our particular
            interest in the data is in correlation of all independent variables
            with just a single output variable: the wine quality!
            <br /><br />So, focussing in on quality...
          </p>
          <p id="section-8">
            we can now add a length encoding to the circles' hue and lightness,
            by turnining the circles into cylinders
          </p>
          <p id="section-empty">
            Nice! Redundant encodings are good for efficiency they tought us in
            visual data school, and here we have some possibly beneficial
            redundancy. <br /><br />Now it's your turn to take this for a spin.
            Just continue to scroll and wait for the big white button to
            interact with that matrix in 2 or 3 dimensions...
