            Data has the tendency to come in rows for observations and columns
            for the variables, measures, metrics or whatever you might want to
            call it. Whenever I meet a new dataset, I am ambling along its
            columns to get an understanding of it &mdash; to profile it. Quite
            literally, I move from column to column and dedicate a good moment
            to get to know a little &mdash; typically running frequencies,
            calculate normal values and check for missings.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this first approach is more of a personal conversation under
            four eyes I try to get more social in the second approach:
            understanding relations between variables. With numerical data one
            would typically bring a correlation matrix along, which gives us an
            overview of associations across all numeric variables in a dataset.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, I've done so analysing 1,600 wines and their
            physiochemical properties, making up a wine's liquid composition, in
            order to build a model aimed to predict a wine's quality. Properties
            like Alcohol, sugars, chlorides (salt), pH Value, acids and more.
          </p>
          <p id="section-0">
            In fact, there's a whole little visual story about these efforts
            over here, and originally this thingy here was supposed to be part
            of that story, but it didn't quite fit, so it gets its very own
            little stage. <br /><br />Be that as may, the wine quality model we
            build over there is a Logistic Regression &mdash; a general linear
            model, which comes with the benefit of being relatively simple to
            explain becasue all it does is modelling correlations between
            &mdash; in our case &mdash; numeric variables. To get an inital
            overview, one would usually use a correlation matrix like so:
          </p>

        <div id="main">
          <p id="section-1">
            I like correlation matrixes. They do the job. Seeing a correlation
            matrix for the first time, you might have to orient yourself a
            little, but once that's done you quickly understand how to read it.
            For the sake of completeness: all your variables are in the rows and
            the columns and the circles encode the correlation magnitude with
            their size and possibly their colour lightness and the correlation
            direction with hue. <br /><br />This is all you need to know to
            efficiently look up each correlation of interest like for example
            the correlation between a wine's pH values and Citric Acid,
          </p>
          <p id="section-empty">
            which seems to be negative, indicated by the orange tint, and quite
            notable &mdash; in this case it's -0.54.
          </p>
          <p id="section-2">
            Or between alcohol and density, also negative, telling us that the
            higher the alcohol → the lower the density.
          </p>
          <p id="section-3">
            Or between the all important wine quality and alcohol, which &mdash;
            maybe unsurpsingly &mdash; is positive. The higher the alcohol → the
            higher the quality (we can sense the limits of correlations in
            reality here as there's probably a tipping point a simple
            correlation won't capture).
          </p>
          <p id="section-4">
            As nice and efficient as this all is, it carries some slack, we can
            prune away; like for example the diagonal of auto-correlations. It
            is sort of pretty obvious that each variable is perfectly positively
            correlated with itself. So off we go.
          </p>

            out there some of which use this space to show for example the
            density distribution of that variable, but to keep it minimal we're
            just removing it here.
          </p>
          <p id="section-5">
            But there's more to cut. In fact, more than half of the matrix can
            go, as the bottom right grid is just a reflection of the upper left
            grid.
          </p>
          <p id="section-6">
            This is it, I guess. To get a full overview, we can't really cut
            away anything else. We can tilt it into a correlation pyramid for
            different aesthetics,
          </p>
          <p id="section-7">
            ...but that's a matter of taste. <br /><br />Now, the reason I
            started climbing down into the correlation matrix basement to start
            with, was a faint call from the 3rd dimension. Whenever I look at
            correlation matrixes, my inner eye doesn't only see circles encoding
            the correlation strength and direction but bars, or cylinders
            pointing up or down. We can't see them as we're looking straight
            down onto its flat survace, but someone needed to free them I
            thought. It turns out the 3rd dimension isn't all too helpful when
            you have a full matrix &mdash; as you can't see the tree for the
            forest, as it were. Too busy. <br /><br />BUT our particular
            interest in the data (full story over here, I won't mention it
            again, thank you very much) is on correlation of all variables with
            just a single variable: the wine quality! <br /><br />So, focusising
            in on quality...
          </p>
          <p id="section-8">
            we can now add some additional encodings to the circles' hue and
            lightness, by turnining the circles into cylinders...
          </p>
          <p id="section-empty">
            Nice! Redundant encoidings are good for efficiency they tought us in
            the visual data school, and here we have some possibly beneficial
            redundancy. <br /><br />Now it's your turn to take this for a spin.
